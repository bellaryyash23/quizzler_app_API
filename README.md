# Upgraded Quizzler App with GUIðŸ“± using Tkinter, Requests API of Python

ðŸŒŸUpgraded the earlier created quiz app to include a dynamic API request call for each run and created a GUI for the app, to enhance the user experience.

ðŸ‘‰In the 'data.py' file which earlier contained static list of questions Now, is a dynamic question data created as it makes API request to GET question data for 
each app run. This data is passes to the 'main.py' file using module call.

ðŸ‘‰The data imported from the 'data.py' file is formated in the 'main.py' file and a list of question & answer is created which, is passed to the 'quiz_brain.py' module.

ðŸ‘‰Now the UI setup is done in the 'ui.py' file using the tkinter classes like Label, Button, Tk, Entry, PhotoImage and Canvas. The Canvas class is 
used to design the background image of the app.

ðŸ‘‰The objects are placed and packed on the window using the .grid(..) method of the tkinter class which divides the whole window into rows and columns.
